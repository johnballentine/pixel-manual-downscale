# Pixel Art Downscaler

The **Pixel Art Downscaler** is a manual, front-end tool designed for developers and artists to precisely restore pixel art to its original, pixel-perfect resolution. Many pixel art images sourced from platforms like Google Images or generated by AI often don't fit a 1:1 pixel ratio. These images are typically upscaled with non-integer values using methods like bicubic interpolation, which leads to blurring and distortions that can't be reversed with nearest-neighbor downscaling. This tool provides a precise, manual method for correcting resolution and offset issues, ensuring the pixel art is restored to its intended clarity.

## Purpose

Pixel art relies heavily on pixel-perfect accuracy, which is often lost when images are upscaled improperly. When using pixel art found online or generated by AI, the original resolution and scaling factor are typically unknown. As a result, these images are frequently misaligned, blurry, or distorted, rendering them unsuitable for use in projects that require pixel precision, like games. This tool solves that problem by allowing you to manually adjust the image’s resolution and alignment to restore the original pixel-perfect form.

## Features

- **Resolution Control**: Use the width and height fields or the arrow keys to manually adjust the resolution. This allows for precise control over pixel size, restoring the image to its original pixel-perfect resolution.
- **Offset Control**: Shift the X and Y positions of the image to adjust for misalignments that occurred during improper upscaling or cropping. Offset control is useful when the image was not saved in the correct pixel boundaries, allowing you to align it properly before downscaling.
- **Display Modes**:
  - **Side-by-Side**: Display the original and downscaled images next to each other for easy comparison.
  - **Overlaid**: Overlay the downscaled image on top of the original with adjustable transparency. Use the slider to adjust how much of each version is visible, ensuring accurate alignment and comparison.
- **Save Image and Metadata**: Download the downscaled image along with a corresponding metadata file. The tool generates both the corrected image and a metadata file containing details such as the original filename, resolution, offset values, and the date of modification.

## How to Use

1. **Resolution Adjustment**: Use the width and height input fields, or the up/down arrow keys, to manually adjust the resolution of the image. This ensures the image is scaled to a pixel-perfect resolution, avoiding any blurring caused by non-integer scaling.
2. **Offset Adjustment**: Use the offset controls to shift the image horizontally (X-axis) or vertically (Y-axis). This is necessary when the image’s pixels are misaligned due to improper cropping or scaling, allowing you to perfectly align the image before downscaling.
3. **Choose Display Mode**:
   - **Side-by-Side**: Display the original and downscaled images next to each other for easy comparison.
   - **Overlaid**: Overlay the downscaled image on top of the original with adjustable transparency. Use the slider to adjust the transparency between the original and downscaled image.
4. **Save Image and Metadata**: Click the "Save Image" button to download both the corrected image and the metadata file. You must allow Chrome (or other browsers) to download multiple files for this feature to work. If prompted, click "Allow" to enable the download of both files.
